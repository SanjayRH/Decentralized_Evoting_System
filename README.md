# E-Voting

Electoral integrity is essential not just for democratic nations but also for state voter’s trust and liability. Political voting methods are crucial in this respect. From a government standpoint, electronic voting technologies can boost voter participation and confidence and rekindle interest in the voting system.

The electronic voting protocols have a single controller that oversees the whole voting process. This technique leads to erroneous selections due to the central authority’s dishonesty (election commission), which is difficult to rectify using existing methods. The decentralized network may be used as a modern electronic voting technique to circumvent the central authority.

Electronic voting systems must be legitimate, accurate, safe, and convenient when used for elections. It has great potential to decrease organizational costs and increase voter turnout. It eliminates the need to print ballot papers or open polling stations—voters can vote from wherever there is an Internet connection.adoption may be limited by potential problems associated with electronic voting systems. Blockchain technology came into the ground to overcome these issues and offers decentralized nodes for electronic voting and is used to produce electronic voting systems mainly because of their end-to-end verification advantages.

# Problem Statement

In democracies around the world, voting is considered a fundamental process for the citizens of a country to have a say in the people who represent them or an issue that impacts them. In days after American independence, voting usually took place via viva voce, or by voice vote. Later on in 1634, Massachusetts became the first state to elect its governor using paper ballots.

For many years, democracies around the world stayed with paper ballots and later moved on to electronic voting machines. Despite system checks, safeguard procedures, and election protocols, these machines are not tamper proof. The critics believe that the proprietary code by which the electronic voting machines operate are secret and can be manipulated. As a result governments around the world have been exploring blockchain as a medium to make the general elections tamper proof and transparent. A system where everyone trusts the data as it is since counterfeit is not possible.

# Solution

In comparison to the conventional voting methods, e-voting has enhanced both the efficiency and the integrity of the process. Because of its flexibility, simplicity of use, and cheap cost compared to general elections, electronic voting is widely utilised in various decisions .

Despite this, existing electronic voting methods run the danger of over-authority and manipulated details, limiting fundamental fairness, privacy, secrecy, anonymity, and transparency in the voting process. Since the e-voting procedures are centralised, licensed by the critical authority, controlled, measured, and monitored in an electronic voting system, is a problem itself for a transparent voting process. Recent controversies in modern democracies such as USA and India amplifies the argument.

It is essential to ensure that assurance in voting does not diminish. In this project we will try to leverage blockchain to fix shortcomings in today’s method in elections and make the polling mechanism clear and accessible, stop illegal voting, strengthen the data protection, and transparent outcome of the polling process. Because of the distributed structure of the blockchain, a smart contract based electronic voting system reduces the risks involved with electronic voting and allows for a tamper-proof for the voting system.
